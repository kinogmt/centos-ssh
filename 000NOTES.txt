This branch, rocky8-fw, is a special branch to workaround Cloudian-8.0EA package issues.
This is only for creating a special container image which includes some RPM files,
which became unavailable on the third-party repository after we release 8.0EA.

So we will NOT merge this branch to the main stream rocky-8 branch.
We will just push the image to quay.io as quay.io/cloudian/centos-ssh:rocky8.7.20221219-fw.
And clouian-qc release-8.0 branch will use this image in docker-compose.yml.

See Jira QC-237 for more detail.
